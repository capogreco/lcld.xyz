This investigation is predicated on the following axioms:

1. As concept users, we are constituted by our commitments.
2. We are constituted as such in relation to a preexisting network of conceptual relations.
3. _Aesthetics_ refers to the domain of forces that govern how desire organises material
4. _Dancing along_ requires one to adopt a primeval sense of correctness.
5. _Musical_ refers to those aesthetic forces that contain an invitation to _dance along_.
6. This primeval sense of correctness is constituted by a set of indeterminate, implicit commitments.
7. Such commitments become both determinate and explicit retroactively, via discourse.

This paper can be understood then, as an investigation into the ways in which the following objects can be said to be _musical_:

- the pipe organ / piano / synthesiser
- the flat-screen television / humurously oversized family 4WD
- the printing press / mobile phone
