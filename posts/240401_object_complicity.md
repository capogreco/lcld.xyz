This investigation is predicated on the following axioms:

1. As concept users, we are constituted by our commitments.
2. We are constituted as such in relation to a preexisting network of conceptual relations.
3. _Aesthetics_ refers to the domain of forces that govern how desire organises material.
4. _Musical_ refers to those aesthetic forces that contain an invitation to adopt a primeval sense of correctness which makes it possible to _dance along_.
5. This primeval sense of correctness is constituted by a set of indeterminate, implicit commitments.
6. Such commitments become both determinate and explicit retroactively, via discourse.

This paper can be understood then, as an investigation into the ways in which the following objects can be said to be _musical_:

- the pipe organ
- the piano
- the electric guitar
- the television
- the humurously oversized family 4WD
- the mobile phone
