This investigation is predicated on the following axioms:

1. As concept users, we are constituted by our commitments.
2. We are constituted as such in relation to a preexisting network of conceptual relations.
3. _Aesthetics_ refers to the domain of forces that govern how desire organises material.
4. _Musical_ refers to those aesthetic forces that contain an invitation to _dance along_.

This paper can be understood then, as an investigation into the ways in which the following objects can be said to be _musical_:

- the pipe organ
- the piano
- the electric guitar
- the television
- the humurously oversized family 4WD
- the mobile phone
