Jack Muller was my poppa. He had the titular condition.

They found an ambidextrous heart surgeon for his triple-bypass.

Several years later, Shane Warne bowled Graham Gooch around his legs.

Soon after, Poppa taught me how to bowl a leg break. 

And then, how to bowl a wrong'un.

<!-- Can you bowl a wrong'un? -->

In each case, the master's discourse emerges where difference begins.

<!-- After all, one never fully knows now does one now does one now does one -->
